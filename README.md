## Overview

Lithium-ion batteries are widely used due to their high energy density and efficiency. However, they require careful management to ensure safety and longevity. The BMS Fast Charging project addresses these needs by providing:

- **Safe Fast Charging**: The system intelligently manages charging rates to prevent overheating and damage.
- **Thermal Protection**: Temperature sensors monitor the battery pack to avoid overheating.
- **Cell Health Tracking**: The system continuously checks the health of each cell to ensure optimal performance.

## Features

- **3S Configuration**: Supports a series connection of three cells for a nominal voltage of 12V.
- **Arduino Nano Integration**: Uses Arduino Nano for easy programming and customization.
- **Current Sensing**: Monitors current flow to prevent overcharging.
- **MOSFET Control**: Utilizes MOSFETs for efficient power management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple setup and operation, ideal for educational and practical applications.
